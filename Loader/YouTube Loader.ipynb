       "[Document(page_content=\"foreign [Music] from redis he's a principal applied AI engineer and his key phrase to describe himself is curious which I find very interesting especially given that if you ask hiring managers for the most desirable features and attributes of a specific type of data scientist usually what you'll hear are some of the softer skills things like ability to communicate or understand business problems and curiosity is one of the top named items that hiring managers are looking for so welcome Sam to the stage [Applause] thank you hey everybody hopefully everybody's still awake all right my name is Sam partie thanks for the introduction I'm here to talk about AI powered search and Vector databases so first I'll ask a question who's had an argument in the last month ended by just Google it yeah come on more of you definitely more of you it happens all the time search is ingrained in our lives almost every day you search something so what I'm talking about today is going to build up from the basics it's going to be really simply how do I get similarity searches with vector embeddings from the absolute Basics from what our Vector embeddings to what our Vector databases and then how do I put this into production with some really simple demos that show the value so first what are vector embeddings well they commonly represent unstructured data so this could be images videos texts audio just like you heard before and they're usually High dimensional so that means 384 Dimensions 768 dimensions and they're created through passing uh by passing unstructured data through machine learning models so this could be Transformer models vies Etc you've heard about a lot of them today but what's really cool about today is that now you have off-the-shelf models like hugging face Transformers that you in about let's see nine lines of code can take unstructured data like texts and create vector embeddings I don't know who else remembers the days when you used to have to create a custom pie torch hook to do this but it was much more painful and this will literally download that model and create those Vector embeddings on the fly so going off Joel's talk earlier this is as simple as it gets in this is something that I get really enthusiastic about I describe myself as curious this is an area I'm incredibly curious curious about because of how simple and easy it is to get started people I know that aren't data scientists could do this because they've done a little bit of work in Python they're software engineers in Python and they can get started with this so that's definitely a theme of this talk is the Simplicity of how you actually can get started with this so how do you actually use these Vector embeddings so similarity search we'll give an example here that's actually ripped right off the hugging face API page these are three sentences that we're going to turn into Vector embeddings so today is a sunny day that is a very happy person that is a very happy dog and we're going to project these into a overly simplified Vector space that you see below that I probably should have made bigger in the slides um but then we're going to calculate the distance between those vectors by using one of the four methods on the right this example will use cosine similarity but you can imagine just calculating like mathematically the distance between two vectors so once again we're keeping this simple in the fact that it's using these high level terms but it's still it's simple in its methodology so then we're going to enter a query vector that is a happy person and our goal here is to calculate how similar that sentence that piece of unstructured data is to the rest of the unstructured data in our data set so here you'll see that is a very happy person that is a very happy dog and that in today is a sunny day make up our data set and each of those blue dotted lines are the cosine similarity between the query Vector that is a happy person and each respective sentence you'll see that the most common one unsurprisingly is that is a very happy person and this will mimic actually the results in the bottom right you see there are actually directly from the hugging face API but if you're curious you can reproduce all of these by going to the blog that you see there which actually will outline a lot more of this talk I only have 15 minutes so the blog does a much better job and what you can see is actually how to do this in pure python in the hugging face API and then later as you'll see in redis so Vector search has a number of use cases um part of my job is actually implementing these four customers and we see all types of things that people want to do with this whether it's visual search for products whether it's natural language search for document retrieval um or you know anomaly detection threat detection recommendation systems for users it could be just about anything that you can take unstructured data create Vector embeddings from and then create an index in search over so as you've seen the vector embedding creation that you saw earlier with that hugging face piece of code on the very first slide is incredibly simple and that makes up the first half of this slide but if you're going to take this into production how are you going to use this in a service and so you need something like a vector database to hold these vectors and actually serve them to your platform do things like create you an index provide you with distance metrics actually serve that data to some endpoint this is what that process looks like but what is a vector database because that's also kind of a loaded term well in general it's a purpose-built data store it has indexing methods it has distance metrics some of the common ones that you see there are flat like K nearest neighbors or approximate ones like hierarchical Navigator hierarchical small navigatable worlds I always mess that up and each of these Vector databases that you can use need at least these three tenets it needs to be fast reliable and scalable it needs to have low latency reads and writes it needs to be highly available and it needs to be scalable to grow with the growing size of your business or your data set redis now can actually handle this type of data so we've introduced a vector data type and in our existing Reddit search module if you're not familiar with the module ecosystem it's essentially plugable uh ways to make redis have different types of functionality but redis search is one of those offering things like full text search Geographic search tag based search which tons of people use for tracking numbers or products or what have you but now you can also use them for Vector search and what's cool is that you can use them together in these things called hybrid queries so that you can actually say I like these shoes but they're technically size 11 men's and I want size 11 women's so you click the you know women's gender tag and that filters everything down and then you can do a vector search with that men's shoe just because you like the way it looks so this provides users a whole new type a whole new way of actually performing search than they have been able to before with something like lexical search or bm25 we provide a number of Cape indexing methods so as I mentioned hns HS and W flat as K nearest neighbors as well as a couple of those distance metrics that you saw on the previous screen so to ground this I wanted to show actual demos so things that have code on GitHub things that you can actually go visit today and use and see how they work so first is this fashion product finder application and what you'll see here is very similar embedding creation Pipeline and in this case we're using sentence Transformers as well as resnet 18 and image to vac to create our Vector embeddings that are loaded into redis we then create and index hsnw in this case h and s w excuse me and then we serve that with a very single very simple single page application architecture which this entire demo is deployed in two containers one redis Enterprise container and one for the single page application all of this code's on GitHub at the link below but I'll show you what an example from this at this code base actually looks like and how kind of simple this code base actually is if you're familiar with asynchronous python this will make a lot of sense if you're not just think about it like how to do an https request asynchronously in Python and in this case all we do is retrieve one of those products whether it's the image it's the image in this this case but whether it's the image or the metadata of that product doesn't really matter we retrieve that by requesting it from redis we create a query and then use that Vector that we've created and loaded into our database to it and get all of the similar products according to the image of that product so just as I described earlier with the example of a shoe you can do so with this type of query and so what I'll actually show here is the application which I'll give you the link to in a minute if you promise not to spam the button and dig it down but here we'll actually show this uh this Nike men's shoe here and you can actually do search by image and so you'll be able to click this and you'll see very similar shoes appear and it's not necessarily all Nike shoes either you know a typical tag based search you might click Nike and then have all a little my trouble um and then what you'll actually see also on this page is the similarity score so one minus the cosine similarity um and so that's the blue number that you see down on the right each of these buttons you can do either the text-based search with the text embeddings or the visual search with the image based embeddings one cool point to point out about this is you can also do apply filters and see how queries work and also uh just to point out as well that these aren't all Nikes like I said there's actually a puma one that you know the algorithm this partic at 18 variant this night men's shoe I should have shown those so this is the link you can actually go and try this out today it's hosted it's not optimized for mobile so try to use it on a computer but you can actually go and click through this and try it out yourself and all of this code once again is on GitHub and the redisventures GitHub so you can check that out there or just come up to me after the talk one more I wanted to be able to show is our archive search capability so this is for archive papers carpathy put out a great archive sanity demo so this is kind of in line with that but we're actually going to use Vector search on the abstracts with sentence Transformers from hugging face with the same application architecture to be able to do document retrieval based on user natural language so simple natural language in this case the first one we look up deep Financial models which aren't a thing but the point is is that users are imperfect right we don't always search the perfect thing in Alexa graphical search like bm25 this probably doesn't return anything useful but in this case it actually has an understanding of that language that you're putting into it and is able to return multiple different papers that are all relevant in the machine learning space that also have to do with deep learning models and finance which would have been a better way to say it but once again users aren't perfect and they don't search the right thing all the time so this is a great way to enable your users to have that kind of fault tolerance in their search capabilities once again predicting medical diagnosis not even about machine learning but yet everything in here that you'll see is a machine learning paper obviously this paper this data set is all machine learning papers um you'll see every single one of them has to do with using machine learning or deep learning to predict Medical diagnoses so you see some for cancer you see some for covid-19 particularly relevant right now and this demo is also available on request we just didn't Host this one so if you want we have a computer with it up if you want to come check it out lastly I want to get to this which is uh we have a partner in this space who actually did a ton of work and built an entire platform on top of our Vector search capability and really enabled new users that aren't necessarily um you know data scientists at heart or data Engineers to be able to benefit from this Vector similarity capability so they have this amazing GUI it's like Tableau and you know it's it's kind of like Tableau and Jupiter had a baby in a sense there's reporting functionality there's all these kinds of observable dashboards about records and most of it is no code with a low code option to use the API and do ingest from there this is relevance Ai and the CEO Jackie Co flew all the way from Australia to hear and answer questions so please go say hey to him and thank him for being here lastly thank you to Mark and Southern data science conference has been a blast and we're grateful to be here thank you all thank you I definitely talked over the time limit are there any questions do we even have time I can't see that direction honestly the light is blinding oh hey yep there you are thank you yeah uh one of these cases for the vector search is to support availability updates when you need to have a filter for availability and it needs to be updated very frequently almost in real time so do the do your system support these frequent updates yeah so that's really that's a really great question so redis at heart is a cache most people actually know it as a web cache supporting you know the the single digit millisecond latencies that you would expect from an in-memory cache and so kind of on paper we already had that benefit in a lot of ways now doing the vector search we kind of are you know benefiting from the fact that we already have a lot of that capability and kind of Enterprise grade update scheduling maintainability you know reliability all kind of built in already which is a huge benefit of building on an open source Community that's as mature as redis um so you know for that way you know we also do work with companies like fees and tacton to do you know feature updates and materialization we're integrated into those platforms and so that also helps with the kind of materialization schedules as well if that's kind of more what you meant but happy to also connect when I get off the stage too awesome thank you so much Sam thank you [Applause] [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'g2bNHLeKlAg', 'title':

masks respirators um gloves things like that and they become one of the like core providers right at the start of covet they shifted all their production manufacturing stuff they're like forget the vodka bottles forget the LED screens we need n95 masks and we need respirators and we need you know these testing kits and we need and they started producing this stuff and they started just winning all these contracts [Music] we're live Sean uh we have a bunch of stuff you you have a you have a a full menu over here and so do I yeah all right I want you to look at my menu here and I want you to just pick something off the menu go ahead and I'll Riff Off it we don't prefer people who they don't they don't know we only write like one or two words so you get like a teaser you're like man what the hell is this about but you don't know what it actually is but I have I put all my stuff in here an accident I have this new researcher who's crushing it he just gives me all the content like five minutes ahead of time but uh Rich neighbor how did I know you'd pick a rich neighbor so there's somebody in my neighborhood who I bumped into and I've just I'm you know I sort of get out there and I collect signals is this you know where where do I place this person on the uh the Billy scale like are they you know are they on their way up are they are they have they made it in life are they really balling out of control where where is this person these people have been balling out of control like when Christmas time came up there was just like the wife went outside and it was just pointing at windows and all of a sudden the house was lit up like a Christmas tree they had like so they had almost like decked out things and they go hey hey um invite your kids over uh this Thursday we have a snow machine they're we're building a Snow Hill in our driveway like uh you you want to do sledding without going to Tahoe what's that like a big snow cone is that what that no it's like a giant truck that comes that creates snow and it piles it up so that your like their house looked like it was in you know Michigan or something like that yeah but it's just like like it's like an ice machine or something yeah it's like yeah something like that yeah like a big snow cone like a big shaved ice thing yeah yeah you were right from the from the beginning you're right so they did this and they had a fake Santa there and I was like man this is a lot for a Thursday afternoon but okay uh this is cool like these people's style they seem really nice and I didn't know what they did so I kind of I hit it with the Google the other day and I was like let's see who these people are and they have a crazy story so they created a company that back in 2014 did this thing it basically it lets you take a vodka bottle they had a vodka bottle that had an LED sign going around it so you could give somebody a vodka bottle that would say happy birthday Sam or like you could program any message I could be like you know uh whatever I could be like you're getting an old [\\xa0__\\xa0] whatever I could write any message on it it would go on your your vodka bottle all right seems kind of gimmicky I don't really you know not a bad idea but but balling out of control from that didn't didn't 100 make sense but that was it sounds like a Drop Shipping like joke sounds like my first idea out of college it's like this is like me in college would have been like bro next next Google I got it what if we took you know this Jager bomb and we put an LED screen on it wouldn't that be incredible and so so they had this thing and they were like licensing this out or something like that somehow like Shaq became an advisor to their company it was really crazy it makes sense yeah as you would five years later covet hits and you know what they decide to do they're like you know what [\\xa0__\\xa0] this vodka thing let's go all in on creating like safety safety stuff for cover like masks respirators um gloves things like that and they become one of the like core providers right at the start of covert they shifted all their production manufacturing stuff they're like forget the vodka bottles forget the LED screens we need n95 masks and we need respirators and we need you know these testing kits and we need and they started producing this stuff and they started just winning all these contracts and so now like if you go look at their website it's one of those I know your Rich websites because there's like not a lot of information on it but if you go to like the P they have like a press release section and it's like PR Newswire company gets 113 million dollar contract with the government for safety equipment oh my God local East Bay success story where they uh they're now the the sole testing provider for you know with the Lakers Stadium Levi's Stadium like all these different places and so these guys are getting 100 million dollar plus contracts for their stuff now I think probably it's like you know probably only like 10 margin when you buy you think it's that selling masks I think for things like that probably it's like 10 15 is my guess maybe maybe during coven everyone was completely price insensitive and they could just charge whatever they wanted I'm not sure I would have thought that but um but wow dude what a what a pivot and uh you know that isn't that just kind of crazy and that was an opportunity kind of available to a lot of people right dude I know a bunch of people who did that and like I had a friend that did it and he's like dude check this out and he sends me a picture of a Shopify store and it's doing like 2 million a month I know a lot of people who did that and I've only followed up with one or two of them and uh I have a feeling that like of the eight people I know who did it like three of them it worked out and then the rest it was like a really quick cash grab but then they over bought inventory and it and it's like nothing do you know people who did that yes we there was a guy in um I had started this Mastermind group that's actually where I found Ben uh but like one of the other guys in The Mastermind group he like every time we came to the testimony does he live in Texas no he's in Canada every time he came to the Mastermind group I feel like he had a different business which is like not what you want in a mastermind group but he was a good dude and he would always be like oh I have this other business that's like oh you know for auto repair blah blah we do their SEO and I was like okay but then what about that thing you told me last time and then one time you came dude we're doing mobile covet testing trucks that will drive up to places and we can just do rapid testing for covet and we were like all right I mean that sounds cool but like are you like do you know anything about covet testing like does anybody in the world know about this like what he's like oh I got the scientist that's going to be great and then he came back and he was like hey um really excited to be here I need you guys help um like three months later he was like I really need you guys help about going public and I was like and he's like yeah we're gonna do like 85 million this year in revenue and I was like what and he's like yeah we're getting all these contracts with the state of uh with like the you know the [\\xa0__\\xa0] in Canada like these country Country-Wide contracts and um you know yeah we think maybe we should take this public next year and I was like oh my God so how did it end I I don't even know because I that that guy my head was just spinning every time uh you know he would talk because I'm like this is either too good to be true or I'm too dumb and this is amazing and I can't tell which one it is it's probably some mix of both but you're right I know several people that went all in on covid right when it happened and like low-key got like an absurd amount of traction very very fast yeah like a ton my dad had actually called me one day and he goes my friend works at this hospital they need extra equipment they need extra masks I talked to somebody in India and they could produce these masks and like I think we could do like a two or three million dollar contract and I was like fantastic um should do it and he's like yeah I wanna but my dad has this problem where my dad is addicted to meetings like he thinks winning is like this important person met with me and then he'll tell me the duration of the meeting to show me the value he's like only scheduled for one hour but we sat there for 90 minutes and I'd be like okay so what like everybody so you know he was really interested two hours right and he was just like he just like always just obsessed with that so he was he just had a bunch of meetings and I was like Dad you're gonna it's all about that action boss you're gonna take some action here what what's gonna happen like go go for it do it and he's like well no I want he's like I want everybody to like sign off on it and de-risk it completely pay me up front and I was just like dude this is this is like the cheap way to do business like you got to take a little risk here you're throwing shade on your dad right now I hope he doesn't listen to this and you called him boss if I said Cosby boss he's getting in the headlock yeah my dad yeah we make fun of each other like we call it like it is I do a bunch of dumb things and I say when I do dumb things this is his dumb thing he is high planning low action on these things and he says it all the time like um we went I went I took him to Tony Robbins and Tony Robbins is all about like taking massive action on like the things you want and he's like I was like what's your big takeaway he's like oh man I need to take Massive Action and I was like that yeah that's that you did it you learned the right lesson from this thing he goes that's my problem I don't take Massive Action I was like whoa he started slipping back into like basically he's like I've identified my problem just like so right so true whatever it worked out for him yeah he did he did great like right for like Village in India to like live in like owning multiple homes dude the story great the story of you tell of your mom of like I think you said she like had never eaten with a fork or something and she just comes to America when she's 17. is that what you said I'm not exaggerating I thought you said I thought you said like she had they didn't use like utensils or she went to a restaurant and like or she actually you're right you're right that did happen no I'm not being disrespectful uh Mrs Perry that's this is the story it's on record and then also when she used a pay phone to call her brother to say that she was in town she didn't know like that you hang it up so she like let it hang yeah and then she she was just crying at the airport and some guy was like hey uh do you need help are you okay she's like I need like my brother's supposed to pick me up I don't know where he is like just landed in America and he said you have a phone number she's like yeah so he that guy picks up the paper film puts in the quarters calls the brother tells him hey she's at Terminal Two she's waiting here I'm gonna tell her not to move brother didn't even know oh your flight was today like you they had no correspondence like okay oh hang tight I'll be there and she talks to him and she's like he's like don't move and then that guy had left the helper had left and so she didn't she's like not only did I know how to use the Payphone I didn't even understand how do you put this back and she's like I kind of was like fiddling with it like kind of like like trying to get it to stick and I didn't know what to do I looked around nobody was there and I just left it hanging and I walked away she's like I'll never forget like just feeling so clueless about the world um and there's like five stories like that on her just yeah they got to America now they have a house in San Francisco so it worked out that's the uh that's the American dream um um all right another topic what do you got I got a quick one here so I saw this Tick Tock of this uh Professor uh some professor at College uh I apologize to her I don't know her name but um let me see if I can find it real quick she basically uh Professor Cooley I don't know what she's a professor Cooley at Emory University so shout out to her basically her she has she teaches marketing at um at this college and for her marketing class she goes all right glass um if you want to do well in this class you want to get an A you have one job go viral on tick tock all right I'll see you I'll see you in a few weeks like if you need help you know we have some maybe maybe some uh we can talk about what it takes to get there but like that's how you get a good grade go viral on Tick Tock awesome how old is she young looking or older younger looking um yeah she looks like you know she looks like if you were 12 she would be your friend's mom um got it all right so something like that whatever age that is perfect description so whatever so basically uh I thought this was amazing and it got me thinking like really how many more classes at a university should be taught this way um so for example like why isn't there a classic you know why isn't there a class at school where it's basically like okay we're gonna have four lemonade stands on campus break up into teams you're each gonna run a lemonade stand like and you know the top lemonade stand is going to get an A plus the next one gets a minus B plus B minus um and if you if you're not able to break this threshold of sales you fail and it's like just let them go and do their thing and let them learn 100 how it should be or it's like you know maybe it's the net profit so to learn about the cost management as well but like give them you know 500 bucks and be like go who can run the best lemonade stand or t-shirt company or whatever it is or writing on Twitter um like you know okay it's an English class should you basically go read Shakespeare and all the stuff or should I basically teach you how to do writing in like the modern day and basically the cold email newsletter cold email or Twitter and it's like yeah you need to grow an audience around whatever topic you're interested in it could be The Bachelor it could be World politics it doesn't matter you pick your topic but you got to write to an audience on that and you got to publish first thing is quantity you got to publish every day for the next 60 days um and then the next thing is going to be quality can you actually grow an audience can you get you know 50 open rate on a newsletter with you know a thousand people on it go figure out how to do that and so things like this I feel like would be so much better than the way that people learn about how to do real world business today in school another one would be flipping like uh everybody you're gonna look under your desk yep you're starting with this drill okay everybody's got a drill like your job is to flip this drill into the most valuable item you can get by the end of the semester go and it's like you got to sell this take the profit buy something else sell that and like just keep doing that until you can get to the biggest thing dude uh Ramon our friend Ramon his son goes to a school here in Texas and he his kid had a class where he had to go haggle and it was like you have to get this much of a discount from a retail store or something like that and I was like Ah that's awesome that was awesome it's like great for a 12 year old so I love that stuff I dude I didn't have CL when I was all right my sophomore year of college I was a division one athlete a runner nonetheless a runner a Peak physical condition they'd made me take a aerobic walking class which was like if you add up the tuition it was like nine grand or something like that so I'm on it was aerobic walking you show up and you go for a walk so I'm all in favor of this stuff I think it's awesome like are you walking at least at like a fast pace why is it called aerobic walking versus just walking is that just branding is this the gym teacher how to justify their their their pension or their uh salary I don't know it was the stupidest thing ever like it was it was crazy it was crazy to me I had to take aerobic I remember this it was ridiculous uh you just like showed up what do you mean you had to seems like they don't force you have to get like these certain amount of credits and it was like this aerobic walking classes was your major like PE why why was this because they make I don't know I don't remember exactly why I had to do this no I don't even remember what I majored in I think just like accounting or business or something it wasn't so I left school early so it was accounting and then I and then I left school and then I finished online later and I was like okay you know give me just give me any diploma that I can get please because um I moved out so I the summer I had to take like some summer classes and one extra semester and uh I heard about Airbnb and I was like that's where it's at so I wanted out there yeah yeah so you you know I think I told you this I had heard about how you applied I didn't know you were in college and dropped out for it I didn't drop out I well I I don't know if it's technically drop out I just like quit going and then I finished online like I couldn't move it to an online student yeah like I took like some time off and then I eventually like finished and I would have to go like to a Kaplan you know like those Kaplan like testing centers and I would have to take these nonsense nonsense tests but basically there's this famous runner I was runner at the time and there was a famous runner named Chris lukasik and he quit running which wasn't exactly lucrative but he was like the seventh most fast fastest Miler ever and he was like I quit I'm quitting running at my Peak to join this thing called air bed and breakfast and I was like what the hell is that that sounds awesome and so I uh emailed Joe gebia the founder of Airbnb and I was like hey uh I I like Airbnb I came up with this interesting hack that I think could help you grow uh here it is and he forwarded it to it was at the time there was this thing called rapportive that had just come out and I built an Excel sheet where you could type in someone's first name last name and like their Gmail or their company name and then it like permutates and you put into this thing and it tells you which email is there so not like that sophistic of a hack at all but it was like new technology and I emailed them and in his head he's probably like this is dumb but like the fact that you came up with this like whatever we'll interview you so the interview and so he puts me to a minion the minion was like hey do you want to come to the Bay Area well I don't know who the guy was but the guy is probably worth a really underused word I'm gonna start using that that's an amazing slander I love it well that minion is probably worth 20 million dollars I mean you know because at the time they were only like 200 people and the guy who he referred me to was like the 17th employee and so his name was Justin I'm still friends with him sorry Justin call you minion but maybe you were like that's your friend I'm friendly with them but he uh they uh they go all right great do you live in the Bay Area and I was in Tennessee at the time I didn't know what the hell the Bay Area was when he said I had never been west of Missouri I'd only basically been to like Missouri and then like whatever the states are when you drive to like Destin Florida for like spring break those are like the only places that I'd been and he goes are you in the Bay Area and I was like of course yeah it goes great come into my office on Monday so it's like [\\xa0__\\xa0] I gotta get out there I gotta figure out what the hell the Bay Area is I thought it was La so I pack up like yeah like Silicon Valley I heard someone make a joke about Silicone Valley but that was like where like porn is I think in L.A I I they're all the same to me I didn't know and so I Googled what the hell the Bay Area is and I bought a ticket and I flew out there and I interviewed with him on a Monday and a Tuesday and then I interviewed with Joe the founder he probably didn't even remember me because it was like a 10 minute interview and then I go home on a Wednesday they offered me the job on a Thursday and then a week later I I called my mom I go dude I got this job this is awesome and they go what the hell is this you stay at someone's home I go yeah I think it's gonna be legit she goes it sounds like a multi-level marketing scheme and I'm like well they have like health insurance and she goes whatever and so my mom drove down and packed up my apartment with me and then shipped me off and like she like gave me a thousand dollars and that was my seed money so I moved out there and this was all in like a three-week span the Sunday night before I'm supposed to start they call me and they go we busted you man you lied about your resume because you have a criminal record at the time I'd gotten arrested uh for DUI and I was like well technically like I'm still like the trial's still happening so like I didn't get convicted yet and they're like yeah but that was it isn't until proven guilty yeah they're like but that was sneaky like we asked you if you've been charged or whatever and I was like you're right I'm sorry so I didn't actually get the job I was hired for like a second but I never had my first day and then fast over two years later my wife ends up going to work there and I remember walking around I'm like uh my alma mater my old Stompy grounds so I never ended up working there but I had a job there for like you know a few minutes and uh you know it could have been something great I would think I would have been like employee 200 I don't know maybe I would have made some money or not but that's the story of Airbnb that's an amazing story I love that and while out there I also had to like take these classes and I remember I didn't have any money I had the thousand dollars that was my my money and I used to have to take this bike and I lived in the dog patch in a warehouse that was 900 a month and I asked her right I live in San Francisco they're like he lived in a dog patch warehouse It's called Dog Patch it's like uh real part of San Francisco by the water and I used to have to ride my bike because I didn't have any money and I had to ride a bike that I took for my roommate all the way up to Twin Peaks to go to the Kaplan like place which is like six miles away literally up the steepest Hills in San Francisco and so I used to have to do those classes and take tests for like months it was horrible but it worked out and now you're here incredible and now dude I used to uh like I like I I learned how to like get get rid of like you could jump on the bus and like when they they would catch you all the time and they'd be like where do you live and I'd be like I don't know uh what's your name and I just like give a name and they're like do you have any ID on you I'm like no I don't have ID and so I remember like there was Zero countries there's zero consequences there are zero consequences I mean That's how little I had like I didn't have cash for a bus fare which is 250 but uh uh yeah it turned out okay what did you do to uh to grow that thousand how did you not just wipe out like because thousand dollars doesn't get you very far in San Francisco so how did you not wipe out in three months on my so when I went to the interview for Airbnb I stayed at the cheapest Airbnb there was which was a bedroom in this guy's house and he had told me he was starting a business and so when I moved back out there I go hey dude uh I don't have a job anymore can I join you I only have like two or three weeks of like payment and then and uh my mother and father had given me a pickup truck for college and I asked them to sell that and they sold it so they gave me four thousand so I was like all right I got like three weeks of rent or three weeks of like living expenses now I just got this influx of four or five grand um I've got like six months of cash let's do this and and so I started I co-founded a a company with this guy a roommate matching company where we would uh post ads on Craigslist saying we were hosting these roommate parties where we would match people up into three and four bedroom apartments because normally it's like uh you're a single person who just moved there don't know anyone so you got to move into a existing bedroom and there's lots of competition so we would post fake existing bedrooms and get 300 people to apply on Craigslist and be like hey this doesn't exist but we'll team you up with 200 other people who Wanna the same [\\xa0__\\xa0] as you and we would host these parties and we would charge people money to attend those parties and after they got an apartment and so we basically spun that up on Weebly and made money right away and that's how I lived amazing uh wow great stories I love this uh I feel like yeah I feel like there's a bunch of I've heard bits of these but not all of them uh this is great and I would ride my bike to like collect these money I would knock on their door after they got the apartment I'm like hey you got my money it was ridiculous uh that's so good uh after this I have to go get a hearing aid and uh I'm gonna get fitted for one and I have to tell you why I forgot to tell you this we are at the Vancouver thing and there is these two women speaking to me afterwards foreign and it was loud so like the problem with my hearing is I can't hear the difference between background noise and the person speaking for me it's hard to tell the difference and these women were talking to me and you probably noticed this I lean in hard so I'm only deaf in one ear but I lean in I lean I turn and I and I I get really close to you and also it was just super loud After Party by the way it was like it was like a club it was like a club it was loud and I also stare at people's lips so I I'll either stare at your mouth or I'll lean in Mr really signals over here the horrible worst signals at this moment comes up to me and I'm leading in and like I'm starting to get really close and I can tell she's really uncomfortable and I I go oh I I'm sorry I forgot to tell you I I'm deaf I can't freaking hear you that's why I'm leaning in so hard and uh it was at that point I was I told Sarah I was like I gotta go I gotta get a hearing aid I can't I'm making people uncomfortable this is why you bring your wife with you to all events just to like you know totally totally make it clear what's happening here dude and I a rule I don't I don't travel alone I love having her around when I travel but that is that's definitely the icing on the cake is having around for that reason yeah yeah you you did the opposite of the billionaire hug you like you went in with the with the Brooke boy lean yeah the broke point lead I'm just staring at her lips and she says I literally tried to watch as the words come out of her mouth and just staring go down her lips and looking and then leaning in and oh man I can tell she was uncomfortable I was like oh I forgot to tell you I can't hear so I'm gonna go get one of those things did you ever learn that like trick from this might be it might have been in like those pickup artist things I'm not 100 sure but you're looking at their the triangle yeah yeah yeah like the third eye or something like that no no it's if you ever wanted if you want somebody to want to kiss you you're close if you let's say you're close you're in range and you want to like kind of almost like hack their little like biology and get them to want to kiss you you you do this like triangle so you basically look at one eye the second I down to the lips back to the first eye so he makes it it traces like a little triangle and if you do that you'll just see immediately the person just pucker up maybe yeah right it just happens um yeah right I don't know if it's because you're signaling that you want to kiss them or that it just makes them want to kiss you but this [\\xa0__\\xa0] works this was like in college I was like you know you would have thought I'm in the Illuminati how many triangles I was throwing up everywhere because I was like this is like a magic trick this thing is amazing did you get any girls in college probably you're really charismatic King baby you had a good batting average but not a home run got that lead off never got a second yeah oh well that's good the hard part two is my roommate was like um just unbelievably good with girls and so he's really good looking good looking guy and he was right here right yeah Trevor he's an athlete and he's just like a professional flirt and so somehow this guy was just pulling crazy people like you know you have like an RA who's like the the person who's like four years older that lives in the Freshman dorm he just started dating the Ra's girlfriend and then like you know he started dating this girl on the basketball team and started dating like all these seniors started dating this like one really rich girl who's giving him gifts all the time I was like I don't know what's happening here but like um you know this guy's definitely sucking up all the the alpha male energy in this room and uh you know I'm just sort of here along for the ride but it's okay it turned out all right uh well you know you worked out all right by the way my dating life was a lot like my startup life it was basically like fail fail fail fail fail home run it's like you know like most people in their career they sort of get this like 10 raise a year or whatever where it's like this linear like steady climb up the ladder but if you're in the startup world you're often like making nothing or in debt or bro and all of a sudden for like seven eight years and then all of a sudden you're rich and uh that's what my dating life was like I was broke for like 10 years and then all of a sudden I was rich 100 same it like it didn't it didn't start picking up until my 20s it was exactly you're trying to get what were you trying to do in your teens bro I tried I tried a lot trust me I tried I just I looked like Napoleon Dynamite I I with braces it just didn't work out dude I didn't talk to a girl I was sitting there reciting lines from The Rock in WWE when I was in my teens bro I was I was jumping off the top rope in my bedroom trying to you know just I love wrestling and basketball and stuff I didn't have time for girls when I was like 15. it was a numbers game for me I knew like you know three percent conversion therefore you know you got to try a hundred times right yeah you never want more of attrition to describe it whatever I it worked out we both it worked out for both of us before we get into this we got to remind people there is a gentleman's agreement except this time it's different so we have this thing at this podcast unlike everything on YouTube and on Spotify and all that stuff our content actually isn't free you're only getting this episode for free if it's your first one and if it's your second or third one you have

even have to watch video just click my first million clip click subscribe turn the notifications on and we need we need this this is what we need right everybody's got needs food shelter YouTube subscribers these are your core core Primal needs and we have ours and uh that's why it's called the gentleman's agreement we're not on the other side so you just have to do it and everyone's doing it lately so you should do it and that's what we expect out of view and also do me a huge favor and actually click follow on the podcast app and Spotify because those help us actually go up the rankings and then we go up the rankings we get more dopamine and we do Dumber [\\xa0__\\xa0] and that's why we're here so do that um I have a story for you so go to joop.com so it's j u p e Jupe so it's jupe.com okay they have a slick looking website so tell me what you see I see some sort of like Mega tent Contraption I don't know what this is this is like some sort of structure it's like is this like a like basically like an outdoor unit that's uh not like something more than a tent but less than a house so I met these kinda I met these guys recently and they're really fascinating and so basically the one of the founders he's like this artist type he's his name's Jeff Wilson and before this he like wrote a book because he lived in a dumpster for a year like he like slept in a dumpster it was like some like art project as well as like to show like for what I don't I don't know I mean he's a wacky interesting guy but he lived in a dumpster and then he uh then he started this like prefab house I guess it was like marketing for like a pre pre-fabricated homes or something like that and um they eventually launched this startup it's called Jupe and I originally saw it because Gary tan famous investor billionaire investor Gary tan made this YouTube video where he stayed in one of their things and so basically what it is is it's I don't know they would be mad if I called it a tent but it kind of looks like a tent but basically they ship it to you on in like a a huge container and you pop it up and on the inside it's like a fancy or like a nice mattress and then there's like a heating and cooling unit and it's got lighting that's all solar powered and so it's like a standalone like house and the way that their business model works is you can do one of two things you could just buy it for 30 grand outright or you can do a thing where you they give it to you for free and they take something like 40 30 to 50 of the revenue and you rent it out and these things are renting out and I was like I don't know man who wants to stay in this thing and he was like dude we rent them out for 250 to 500 a night and they're always booked and they're trying to pitch it to me to put it on my land and I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not but they're it's a pretty interesting thing this year they're supposed to do like 12 million in revenue and it's break even and they've deployed 400 of these things and their future what they're doing is they've got these guys that are just buying plots of land and then putting 15 or 20 of these on there and then dupe the company if you do the profit sharing with them they kind of run it for you so they have like their own little platform and they like will help manage the thing for you but it's pretty fascinating and I've been thinking about putting one of these uh on my on my property I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it or not because I don't know if I want more work but really fascinating interesting idea that I came across I've been loving these ideas where you just make more money off the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that you already have so like I have land and I was like should I just like put these all over my place but they look kind of fascinating and I thought you'd get a kick out of it yeah I mean these look super cool and I got a couple credit because I see a lot of these like um like this kind of like I forgot what's called adus or whatever it's like this additional dwelling unit or something um and they're often just like vaporware it's just a render of something that looks sick and what I really like is if you click their Vision tab it opens up a notion it explains what they're doing and four times in this thing it just says here's our thing parentheses not a render here's what it looks like you know after it gets delivered here's what it looks like the next day again not a render like hey we actually build the thing it exists this is real this is not like some futuristic dream um and so I think that's pretty pretty pretty amazing this looks super cool I don't know why you wouldn't do this just for even like the story so uh I can I have an update so my I have this property uh marathonranch.com and you can see it it's doing like uh anywhere from 13 to 17 000 a month in gross revenue and um so it's doing well I'm like making money on my Airbnb finally I got like 40 or something like five star reviews on Airbnb and I finally started going up the rankings and it's been really fun to do and so I'm not sure but I have 20 acres 20 acres of land I'm not sure if I want to like screw anything up because dude at my Airbnb I we have like 20 cows so my neighbor his account well that's true but like people my neighbor owns these cows and they use our property and in exchange we pay less property tax and people like wake up to like a moving cow because they sleep and wake they sleep at all my property for some reason they decided that's the bed and I don't know if I want to like screw that up it's like so peaceful going out there so I don't know if I want to screw that up by having more units on the property but uh dude Marathon ranch.com your photo here you chose the wrong photo you chose like a not awesome looking photo for your hero photo then if you click Gallery you all of a sudden see all these awesome photos it's a work in progress my friend it's a work in progress Ive it's still in beta yeah it's because one of the pictures it you couldn't see the writing anyway it's a whole thing I gotta fix but uh anyway it's going well I I always I basically to listeners I send Sean updates on my Airbnb and he's like oh that's neat you're making five percent you're making five percent return that's that's really that's lovely what did I tell you you were like dude this is if this is five percent or seven percent or seven percent of years it's great I go and I told you I go I've lost more money in crypto than you'll ever make on your Airbnb yeah somehow that felt like a good statement to me that's a man the Airbnb game it's been fun it sucked for a minute and then once I started rolling it is pretty dope so maybe one day you'll you'll be convinced but right now it's killing it I don't know if they'll kill it in like June when it's like 100 degrees but we'll see to me the only reason I would do this is the tax benefits if I bought property um the actual like rental income and or and or slow real estate appreciation to me is not worth it especially given the headache of doing stuff so you said let's say from a financial investment it's only been okay but from a like reward like it's been quite exciting what is the margin so you say 13k a month um gross okay so now we take out what Airbnb we take out Property Management we take out utilities we take out what what how much what's the gross on that so like a like a record month recently was like 17 000 but let's round down to 15 000 because that's what it's been lately so that's gross so I give away so I own the property outright but I assume that I have a mortgage so if you assume that I had a mortgage plus utilities and taxes that's in the 7 000 range okay um I don't have that but let's just assume that I do because I will get one eventually um and then property management is 20 of uh of uh like the 14 000. so if I do 50 if I do 16 000 Revenue three hundred dollars per stay goes to my cleaner so whatever that let's just say that's two thousand so that brings us down to whatever that is what I say 15 minus two thousand that's thirteen thousand and then management gets 20 of that and then the rest I assume it goes to a a property um property taxes and a fake mortgage so all said and done on fifteen thousand in Revenue I'll walk away with only three thousand maybe yeah that's nuts so that means let's see uh we did we have 15 000 so 20 margins yeah it's it's not like it's not kids on the 15. well but I have depreciation so I'm able to like save a fair bit there but um yeah like it's a cash on cash return it's gonna end up being like five or somewhere between five and eight percent but if you assume appreciation which is a big assumption but I looked at the trailing 30 Years it'll probably be a 15 to 20 percent uh annual return if I own it for like 10 years right so but that's a big if so that cash on cash it's only okay it's only okay but I'm completely hands off and I also like it and I've I learned how to do something so I didn't I didn't do everything I didn't do everything right here at all I I think I paid a premium I definitely paid a premium for the property dude I know you paid a premium because if I look at this uh like if I go to the gallery it's got the kitchen with like the white everything's like white and like this one look of wood that I'm just like a sucker for if it looks like this I'm like it's a nice place people yeah we know about construction they're like this is like cheap and easy like you know I would walk into a house and like well this is a good house so I'm gonna pay a premium for this house if they're like why because the countertops are nice and I'm like yeah I mean look at this it looks fantastic looks modern and they're like dude that's that costs nothing like you need to pay for a location you need to pay for square footage you need to pay for all these other things but I'm a sucker for like just like the countertops but I have 20 acres and so my my plan my plan originally before the Market's tanked I was like I'll put more I'll build more crap there and then when the Market's tanked I got cold feet and I was like well let's just sit on it and just see what happens and so now I'm just sitting on it and it's going awesome like it's it's it's booked constantly and so I'm happy with it I don't regret it I would I would do it again um and I but like I learned it was a lot of money to like you know it was seven figures to like get in the game and so I was [\\xa0__\\xa0] nervous as hell right it's worked out and I've learned how to do it so now I know more about it so I'm happy happy I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right let me go um I got two blue collar hustles for you so these are in the trash in the trash Biz so um I've heard of two trash misses recently that I thought were pretty interesting I wanted to share them with you I want you to tell me which one you like better okay so the first one our buddy Sie Ava told me about this it's called smash my trash have you ever heard of this has he told you about this no but you want to know something funny I've been very close with cieva for like 12 years now and I don't I still don't know how to say his last name [Laughter] yeah I I just he's in my phone book as the very first time I ever met him I just he said he was Russian so he's just saved as cieva Russia and so I just assumed he was Cave of Russia I mean this guy was like in my wedding clothes save a tall handsome smart yeah I just called him Adonis yeah first name and then attributes like visual attributes I remember you buy Six Pack six three got it I have a system and it serves me well um all right so Stephen was telling me about this franchise called smash my trash and so what they do is they basically imagine a giant like Crane and so they drive to any business and like if you've ever been to like we had a warehouse so our warehouse just produces like an um like an ungodly amount of trash just cardboard you don't just burn it just be normal so we have Charlie Charlie burns the trash but like I forgot at that um you would have basically a dumpster and you get charged per like I don't know like per filling of the dumpster like how many times you fill the dumpster and then you call them up and they come and they empty your dumpster what smash my trash does is they'll you sign up for them they drive around they'll come to your dumpster and they just take this giant crane arm and just smash the trash in just compacting it um they let you get way more volume or less it takes less fill so it lowers your trash bill and um you know that could save you hundreds of dollars every month if you do this and so basically the cost of smash my trash should just be less than the savings that they give you from having to do less uh less dumpster fills and so this is like a franchise that kind of crushes it basically you can run this with like two guys and the numbers on this are you invest like I don't know 400k typically they'll make like a million dollars a year in revenue and like 300K of like net income like even a at the end of the day and so you're getting like a kind of amazing cash on cash not not that not that trash returned you were getting on your Airbnb this is some real real returns and um and I think they have I think they have like a [\\xa0__\\xa0] ton of locations I think they have like 160 locations or something like that um and so that's like they've made probably 40 50 million dollars in just a franchise fees just uh franchising this concept out so I think this is kind of a like low-key amazing business it's amazing but there's a big downside when was the last time you had a blue collar job do you remember have you ever had one restaurant yeah when I was restaurant not 21 yeah what happens at a restaurant when it closes do you remember just Carnage Carnage everyone goes and gets super screwed up they get drunk you take pills you get hot you just do all types of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then hopefully they show up the next day and there's lots of like I remember I've you know I've I've been a janitor before I've worked in restaurants I've done all this stuff and there was like particularly in restaurants there was constant like issues with this type of person who works there and it sounds classless but it is kind of The Facts of my experience I don't know what do you think the trash I guess if a trash person has a job maybe they get up early so and I when I think of a trash guy I think more of a Family Guy yeah for some reason I trust a trash guy like you know I feel like a trash guy is reliable dependable salt of the earth you know like I feel like it's not the degenerates that you'll get like I would rather hire any Trash guy than a barista at Starbucks right like I feel like the Barista is a flake and we never know what's gonna happen but well the worst is is is like a bartender yeah or a waiter at a fancy like nighttime restaurant like a like a like a or like a like a TGI Fridays like you know what I'm saying like the worst of the worst there's someone out there right now listening to this that is a waiter at TG Fridays it just slam their phone in disgust dude I've worked at all these places I've worked at all these places and like this is probably why I had a little bit of a habit it's I don't know man this is the downside of if you have unlimited access to loaded nachos then something just happens to you yeah yeah like the blooming onion it's like uh it's like it's like the full moon you know what I'm saying like I turned into a werewolf if I get that every night you know like it's it's bad I try to do like a like a Guns and Roses after party like I'm going wild I'm throwing furniture out the window so uh yeah is this cool yes I think there's a lot of headache and I would be curious we have a good friend uh or I'm I think you're friends with them his name's Brian Brian uh scudimore or scuttlemore he owns um sounds like a good friend got junk and Brian has been on the Pod and uh he uh I don't know if maybe I could say this but the company's 100 bootstrapped Revenue this is public Revenue I think is in the 300 to 50 350 million dollar a year range he owns 100 of it he parlayed that now they own like a painting business and they do all these like Services I would be curious what he would have to say is like his trash guys like or his franchisees are like degenerates or not and like what's the headache with those type of people we should definitely ask him I feel like uh I feel like he's gonna give his sign off on this so so this is one trash idea the other one comes from Twitter I gotta give credit to Mobile Home Park guy um I I know the guy behind us he's actually pretty awesome but I don't know if he's trying to be public with his identity here but he's part of our our guy Mafia right we got the the restaurant front guy we got the car dealership guy now we have a mobile home park guy and he goes I just found this trash business that is called bin scrub and what they do is they clean off your trash cans so they wash the power wash your trash cans because everybody's trash cans are filthy he's like he's like here's how I would take this business and turn it into you know six figures a year of profit he goes why do I love this business so everybody's got trash bins so you know your Market is every home um it's a very young industry low Market penetration so you'll probably be the only person offering this service is not like a bunch of competitors yet um you just need one truck and some hustle uh in a post-covered world there's lots of germaphobes and you can play on that and this has like word of mouth virality so you know this has like public virality you can see the actual service being done and so he goes so he goes you've got to buy a truck the trucks are about 40K but it's a hard asset you're going to be able to get a loan against this so you might only have to put down five or ten thousand dollars and get a bank to finance the rest because the truck will do this um he goes now here's how I how is here's how I juice this business to make it more more valuable hey guys we're gonna make it make this like the ice cream truck we're gonna put a speaker system on top and every time we're coming around your neighborhood we're playing the same song He's like you know I'm going with Outcast So Fresh So Clean just like just because it's a pun and he's like we're gonna play this every single time this song is our branding we're gonna drive around from 3 P.M to 8 PM when people are home from school home from work and they can look out the window and be like what is that and then they will they will see us power washing someone in their neighborhood's bins you can even it's like a horrible idea hold on hold on hold on he goes um he goes we're gonna we're gonna like basically leave little flyer brochures on top of everyone's bin so when they take out the trash they're gonna see that you know this trash can is dirty we clean them out we we leave your trash can so clean you could eat cereal from it and he's like that would be my he's like my I put a spoon in it be like you're so clean you could eat cereal out of this um so he's like that's what I would do for my marketing he goes I think one truck can do about 100 to 200 homes a day it's a few thousand dollars a day per truck in Revenue um you'll use that to finance the second truck your costs are gas water maintenance some chemicals assuming you're the one doing the truck and he's basically like this is a blue collar side hustle if somebody wants to themselves get out there and get to that 10K a month of of income uh that they may not be able to get out of their job this is this is his idea so he goes what do you think fella so Sam you said it's a horrible idea tell me why uh okay so completely uneducated here so two doubts uh I don't think that you can do I I don't think that that many people would want this and number two 100 to 200 a day that's so many that is so many I would how much it would take 20 minutes to drive somewhere I don't that math is wild to me yeah you'd basically have to get to a like dense area and then and then do a route but that would kind of assume that they're all your customers which they're not gonna all because your customers at the start did he call us out and say what do we think no but oh you know he listens to the Pod so uh by the way there's two people there's two people in the comments here one um sparkling bins business they make the trucks so there's a woman in the comments goes it's a fantastic business we've been we manufactured the trucks it's been going great since 2020 and then another guy goes um yeah I do this mine's called bin Busters I'm two years in it's going great okay well I mean what the hell do I know and by the way that guy his bio says living the American dream uh good good for him he's this is their dream and they're they're pulling it off uh uh I don't know man I'm out I'm out in this one I don't want to do this it was like start a newsletter yeah start a newsletter dude I uh I I I've people make fun of me because I bring this up so much I had hot dog stands whatever but I used to work with my hands outside it's so hard man it is so you said you were a janitor when were you a janitor uh when I was in eighth grade I worked at a bakery and it was my job to like mop the floors take out the trash clean the dishes and so that was like my first job six dollars an hour and then uh yeah that's what I did dude I am so mad at my parents for never giving me my my my grind story like can I you didn't do anything hardship yeah like yeah you ain't gangster at all I mean an Uncle's store for a month and just just give me that story five dollars an hour and I had to empty the trash like nobody knows how long I did it like I got nothing dude I grew a lot of Asia parents don't want you to do that they say do your home hands got no calluses yeah and my kids I'm gonna give them one hustle story you know they're gonna have some very token small hardship that will sound good later when they make it because you need that story and I I just don't have it a lot of my Indian friends which I have a ton they their parents were like you don't even clean your room just do your homework just study is that what they said to you like like don't cook don't clean just study well they didn't say it like that but I wasn't asking to cook or clean so it just never came up and they were like yeah your your job is to study and do good in school so you can get like a good job don't go be a janitor and I was like dude I did it all man I did the janitor stuff I was a waiter I was a busboy I was a valet driver I did it all man and uh I'm happy I did it but uh I don't want to do it anymore oh and by the way I need to redeem myself I made fun of like the someone the other day said the retail class so this is like the the blue collar class but uh I read this there was this funny article on Business Insider it had the worst but hilarious title and it was I'm a millennial manager who works with Gen Z and then said like Colin with Gen Z workers they have a lot of feelings and so look you're either gonna like somebody you're gonna have drug issues work with one group of people or you're just gonna have to talk forever about like bringing your whole self to work and all that nonsense so like we all have our faults we're all screwed you know what I'm saying I hate when people say bring your whole self to work I'm okay with you just bringing your work self to work that's cool too you don't have to prefer that yeah I prefer that if you want to bring a little bit more of yourself we could talk about that too but like you know it's not a mandatory you don't have to bring your whole self right I'm okay with just your work self so we all every every every class and every generation has issues so I don't mean to throw shade just at one um we throw shade at all here we're at equal opportunity shade thrower yeah Dad Sam is the trash man I'll make fun of myself someone made fun of me the other day because I've got these surgeries on my ear I was talking about my ear and my glasses sit funny I don't know if you notice my glasses sit crooked because like it's my ear and someone said uh it looks like Sam got brain Sam got head surgery didn't pay for him to put the rest of it back in because of his glasses are sick and I was like no that's kind of kind of accurate yeah yeah you're kind of there um dude I told you the other day I want to tell you about a media company that most people have no idea about but they kind of killed it and I love it so I told you the other day about about parcast I tell you about parcast yeah yeah this was the uh podcast Network that was doing True Crime stuff yeah so I learned about the story I think the guy who started just tweeted saying that he was done at Spotify so I guess his or not is up but listen to this so it was a three-year-old uh startup that sold for 50 million dollars to uh Spotify and the way it started was the guy his name was Max Cutler at the time his 27 year old graduate and he bootstrapped this thing his dad worked in radio I don't think his dad was like a rich guy I think his dad uh Ron Cutler I think he was like a uh he was a radio broadcaster so he had industry but I don't think he was like in the business type of thing and he uh they bootstrapped this thing and by 2018 it's only two years in they had 16 shows with a hundred million downloads by 2019 they had 40 weekly shows now they have a staff of something like 150 of which 75 of them are voice actors and I listen to these it's so weird I listen to these every night when I go to bed so like I've got like my favorites I listened to one called serial killers there's another one called deathbed confessions and there's another one called like murder couples which is about Bonnie and Clyde there's another one like it's like all these things and there's and it's not like our podcast at all there's zero riffing and it's like voice actors see we should just make up fake True Crime shows like stabbed but not dead yet the black guy yeah I just just like stories that people just got mind of her was it really an accident yeah spit on by a homeless guy stories of NYC exactly not injured but it was gross yeah barely assault uh you hurt my feelings True Crime Thrills dude and but like this is the reason why I like this is it's not like uh it's like they're just like you know how weird talking about like people who do things beautifully done like you know uh This American Life and it's like thoughtful it's like thoughtful like today on This American Life we're gonna talk about like the opioid crisis and they like go out and interview people this is not that it's just someone who read a book summarized it and then is reading it and they pump out like literally one a day and they have like uh you know 40 shows in that 40 shows now and it's just a volume play and this guy was like dude this true crime [\\xa0__\\xa0] to Their audience is 75 women and then me uh and they're they're like Their audience like it's crack it's crack to me I cannot stop listening to this [\\xa0__\\xa0] and it's the same thing every single day you know it's kind of like Family Guy you know Family Guy they've been doing it for like 25 years now it's the same [\\xa0__\\xa0] all the time it works every time I'm gonna watch it every single time it's just like that it's the same shtick over and over and over again and they were acquired it was they required for something like 53 million or 54 million dollars in cash and then like another 50 million in earn out but pretty fascinating this guy bootstrapped this and they're not popular on social 20 000 followers Twitter 36 on Facebook 50 000 on Instagram they just dominated like people searching for their their one podcast is called serial killers that's all it's called and they just like dominate when people search these so it's like long tail it's like what's the difference what's SEO for podcasts peo I don't know uh and they just crushed it really fascinating business and I brought that up so I did it I hadn't done the proper research I needed to kind of close that Loop you know there's a we had talked about the beautifully done like you know just X but beautifully done there's another version of that that we haven't talked about and uh I don't know I don't know about you but like when I was growing up like if I had like a plate of food and it's like let's say it's I had a bunch of veggies I had a broccoli a brussels sprouts stuff like that I didn't really want it I was kind of like tired of eating it but it's still there and I know I should eat it um me and my sister used to have this thing where if one of us was like in that that spot where we wanted it we know we should do this but oh God just the idea of sitting here for another 20 minutes just spoon after spoon of this that's I just can't bring myself to do it one of us would look at the other and just say Savage just Savage you start to eat just like an absolute animal and you in like 30 seconds you do they say it's like chugging for food and so um we used to say that and it would be like all right we got to Savage it and we would just quickly down the whole thing now there's a version of that for businesses that's kind of what you described here was this guy was like oh okay people like this true crime audience pumping this out I'm gonna Savage it and so basically in two years to pump out 40 shows and get a hundred million downloads there's only one way to describe that he Savaged it and it he wasn't trying to be beautifully done I bet you it's imperfect in all these different ways you know he might have been hiring you know random voice actors and you know Paraguay and like doing whatever it took to get these out there and pump them out but that's exactly what he did and I think actually way more often than the beautifully done do you see people just Savage it and just just scale up like an absolute Savage because they find something that works and then they don't they're not perfectionists and they don't like um they they don't get limited by what's the normal Pace they're like and that works what's the theoretical limit of this and that works more I remember when I lived in San Francisco when I started the hustle I was like originally I was like let's just pump out blog posts and people are like well what about quality over quantity and I was like dude did you bring yourself to work again yeah I was like dude I well I was I would always turn on I go no our quality is quantity right like we are not we are not an article business we are like how many how how can these operations be where we pump out lots of Articles that's the product we're building you're not a journalist you're a blogger go go blog it was like and then another that was always one where like people are always like quality versus quantity and I'm like uh you need both or if I want to play with their heads I'd be like no the quality is the quantity another thing where people would say is like uh well it's a marathon not a Sprint and that was like a a reason for them to slack and I'm like yeah but have you ever ran a marathon at world record Pace it's gonna feel like a Sprint so like you know it feels pretty fast when you're running real like top marathoners we're running fast so it's gonna feel like a Sprint uh but yeah this guy is a quantity over quality guy and I love it yeah I love it exactly okay I think we should uh we should wrap it here that's the pond [Music]\", metadata={'source': '6Ub7Z1AGIuk', 'title': 'This Family Made $100M+ From COVID!!
